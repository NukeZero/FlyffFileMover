# Flyff File Mover

Flyff File Mover is a file transfer tool featuring a graphical user interface (GUI) built with C#. It reads a list of file paths from a JSON configuration file (FlyffPath.json) and transfers each file from its source location to the specified destination.

While originally designed with Flyff servers in mind, it is versatile and can be used for a wide range of file transfer scenarios.
